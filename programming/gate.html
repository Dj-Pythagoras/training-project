<h1>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering</h1>
<p>The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science. GATE is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science and seven Indian Institutes of Technologies at Roorkee, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai (Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay) on behalf of the National Coordination Board â€“ GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India.</p>
<p>The GATE score of a candidate reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for admissions to various post-graduate education programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies. Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian public sector undertakings for recruiting graduate engineers in entry-level positions. It is one of the most competitive examinations in India. GATE is also recognized by various institutes outside India, such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Bachelor's degree holders in Engineering / Technology / Architecture (4 years after 10+2/ Post-B.Sc./ Post-Diploma) and those who are in the final year of such programs.
</li>
  <li>Master's degree holders in any branch of Science/Mathematics/Statistics/Computer Applications or equivalent and those who are in the final year of such programs.
</li>
  <li>Candidates in the second or higher year of Four-year integrated master's degree programs (Post-B.Sc.) in Engineering / Technology.
</li>
  <li>Candidates in the fourth or higher year of Five-year integrated master's degree programs or Dual Degree programs in Engineering / Technology.
</li>
  <li>Candidates with qualifications obtained through examinations conducted by professional societies recognized by UGC/AICTE (e.g. AMIE by iE(i), AMICE(i) by the institute of Civil Engineers (India)-iCE(i)) as equivalent to B.E./B.Tech.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Verbal Ability: English grammar, sentence completion, verbal analogies, word groups, instructions, critical reasoning and verbal deduction.</li>
  <li>Numerical Ability: Numerical computation, numerical estimation, numerical reasoning and data interpretation.</li>
  <li>Engineering Mathematics (not for all Papers)</li>
  <li>Technical Ability: Technical questions related to the Paper chosen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Duration and examination type</h2>
<p>The examination is of 3 hours duration, and contains a total of 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onwards, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs (four answer options out of which the correct one has to be chosen) and Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse).Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.</p>
<h2>Questions and marking scheme</h2>
<p>The examination will consist of totally 65 questions, segregated as One-mark and Two-mark questions. Out of 65 questions, 10 questions will be from General Aptitude (Verbal and Numerical ability) and 55 questions will be Technical, based on the Paper chosen. The General Aptitude section will have 5 One-mark questions and 5 Two-mark questions, accounting for about 15% of total marks. The Technical section and Engineering Mathematics section will combinedly have 25 One-mark questions and 30 Two-mark questions, accounting for about 85% of total marks. Further, all the sections will have both Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs and Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs. The examination awards negative marks for wrong MCQ answers. Usually, 1/3rd of original marks will be deducted for wrong MCQ answers (i.e. -0.33 for wrong One-mark answers and -0.66 for wrong Two-mark answers) while there is no negative marks for NATs.</p>
<h2>Result and test score</h2>
<p>GATE results are usually declared about one month after the examinations are over. The results show the total marks scored by a candidate, the GATE score, the all-India rank (AIR) and the cut off marks for various categories in the candidate's paper. The score is valid for 3 years from the date of announcement of the GATE results. The score cards are issued only to qualified candidates.</p>
<h4>Normalized GATE Score (new procedure)</h4>
<h5>Calculation of "normalized marks" for subjects held in multiple sessions (CE, CS, EC, EE and ME):</h5>
<p>From 2014 onward, examination for CE, CS, EC, ME and EE subjects is being held in multiple sessions. Hence, for these subjects, a suitable normalization is applied to take into account any variation in the difficulty levels of the question sets across different sessions. The normalization is done based on the fundamental assumption that "in all multi-session GATE papers, the distribution of abilities of candidates is the same across all the sessions". According to the GATE committee, this assumption is justified since "the number of candidates appearing in multi-session subjects in GATE 2014 is large and the procedure of allocation of session to candidates is random. Further it is also ensured that for the same multi-session subject, the number of candidates allotted in each session is of the same order of magnitude."</p>
<p>Based on the above, and considering various normalization methods, the committee arrived at the following formula for calculating the normalized marks, for CE, CS, EC, EE and ME subjects:[13]

Normalized mark (
M
ij) of jth candidate in ith session, is given by</p>

<ul>where,
  <li>M <sub>ij</sub> is the actual marks obtained by the jth candidate in the ith session,</li>
  <li>M <sub>g</sub> <sup>t</sup> is the average marks of the top 0.1 % candidates in all sessions of that subject,</li>
  <li>M <sub> g</sub> <sup>q</sup> is the sum of mean and standard deviation of marks of all candidates in all sessions of that subject,</li>
  <li>M <sub>ti </sub>is the average of marks of top 0.1 % candidates in the ith session of that subject,</li>
  <li>M <sub>iq</sub> is the sum of mean and standard deviation of marks of all candidates in the ith session of that subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>After evaluation of the answers, normalized marks based on the above formula will be calculated using the raw (actual) marks obtained by a candidate in the CE, CS, EC, EE or ME subject. The "score" will be calculated using these normalized marks. For all other subjects (whose tests are conducted in a single session), the actual marks obtained by the candidates will be used in calculating the score.</p>
